# hello-world
The first example repository.

Hi!

I try Github again today(2018/12/14), because I found an interesting github project--GamingAnywhere. 
And I try to describe what I'm thinking about this moment after I noticed the importance of get information about something I want to know.
This is just a simple thing that I need to do, and I am doing now.
Whenever if I read this in the future, I hope it can remind me that I should do whatever I want to step by step! Get information and try to understand them.
